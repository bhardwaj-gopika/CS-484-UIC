## Guide to accessing web application

1. Go to http://localhost:3000/.
2. Use the side bar to go down to the 'Login'. Create a new user using 'Sign Up'. 
3. To ensure strong password, kindly input password length > 8.
4. Using your credentials, login into the portal.

# Unit testing with JEST
For Assignment 2, two test cases have been implemented to verify the requirement of secure and strong passwords.

```bash
cd assignment-2---final-project-repository-team23
npm test
```
1. CORRECT USAGE 
Password length should be greater than 8.
2. ERRONEOUS USAGE 
Password length is not greater than 8.

These two test cases cover "checkPasswordLength" function (defined inside " ./helper/helperFunctions.js ")

# Future Plan 
Unit tests to check critical back-end functions - 
1. Check secure storage of passwords in the database
2. Visualization of the data resourced from an external REST API using a charting library with user being able to manipulate the data as per user's desire.
3. User able to create, delete and update their account
